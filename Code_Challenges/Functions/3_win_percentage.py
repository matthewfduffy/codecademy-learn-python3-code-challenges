    3. Win Percentage
    Create a function called win_percentage() that takes two parameters named wins and losses.

    This function should return out the total percentage of games won by a team based on these two numbers.
"""
# Write your win_percentage function here:
def win_percentage(wins, losses):
    return ((wins * 100) / (wins + losses))


# Uncomment these function calls to test your win_percentage function:
print(win_percentage(5, 5))
# should print 50

print(win_percentage(10, 0))
# should print 100
