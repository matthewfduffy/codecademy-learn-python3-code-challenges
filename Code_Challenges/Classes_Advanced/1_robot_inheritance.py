# 1. Robot Inheritance
# Create two new classes which inherit from the Robot class. The first class is the DriveBot class which should use the Robot constructor. The speed of the DriveBot will be represented by the motor_speed. You can pass in motor_speed as a parameter in the superclass constructor. The next class is the WalkBot class. This class should also use the Robot constructor, but the speed is represented by steps_per_minute which you can pass into the superclass constructor. Additionally, the WalkBot constructor should include another parameter for step_length. This should default to 5 if not provided and should be assigned to an instance variable called step_length.
