# 3. Conditional Superclass Logic
# Create the method avoid_obstacles within the WalkBot class which overrides the same method from the Robot class. This method should call the superclass avoid_obstacles method if obstacle_found is True and the speed is less than or equal to 60, otherwise rotate the robot by 90 degrees (adding 90 to the current direction) and set obstacle_found to False. The direction should not be able to go above 360 degrees (use modulus in a similar way as the superclass method). In either case, the speed and step_length of the WalkBot should be halved to ensure that the robot does not fall over when turning to avoid the obstacle.
