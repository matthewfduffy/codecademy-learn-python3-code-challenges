# 5. Prevent a Robot Takeover
# Update the WalkBot class to keep track of how many WalkBot objects are created. If the total number of robots is 10 or above and there are at least 5 WalkBot objects created then set all_disabled to True for all robots. Use a class variable called walk_bot_count within the WalkBot class.
