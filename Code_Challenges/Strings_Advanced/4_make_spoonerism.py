# 4. Make Spoonerism
# Write a function called make_spoonerism that takes two strings as parameters named word1 and word2. Finding the first syllable of a word is a difficult task, so for our function, we’re going to switch the first letters of each word. Return the two new words as a single string separated by a space.


# Option 1:


# Uncomment these function calls to test your function:
#print(make_spoonerism("Codecademy", "Learn"))
# should print Lodecademy Cearn
#print(make_spoonerism("Hello", "world!"))
# should print wello Horld!
#print(make_spoonerism("a", "b"))
# should print b a


# A Spoonerism is an error in speech when the first syllables of two words are switched. For example, a Spoonerism is made when someone says “Belly Jeans” instead of “Jelly Beans”. We are going to make a function that is similar, but instead of using the first syllable, we are going to switch the first character of two words.
